# Who am I?

Hello, I am [Th√©otime Berthod](https://theotimeberthod.vercel.app/fr). Passionate about programming and touching everything, I really appreciate the front but also the back. I practice Python and Javascript, but decided (recently) to get to C.

Blind, I use [NVDA](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda) on Windows and VoiceOver on Mac. The use of these screen readers allows me to have a different approach to accessibility of sighted users.
